      Intro: `I'm a self-taught dev as passionate as it gets: I started learning to code when I was in my teens & never stopped since then. On a daily basis I'm spending 
				the majority of my free time building side projects and researching anything Crypto related, both from a technical and a personal perspective. I believe permissionless 
				distributed systems are one of the most amazing thing there are, and that we -devs- should strive to improve them & live to the ethos of decentralization. I also happen to be really fond of UI/UX`,
